\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) of noble metal nanoparticles, originating from the collective oscillations of conduction electrons, are strongly dependent on the size, shape, composition and the surrounding environment. %http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jp500638u

This plasmon resonance of coupled particles depends on interparticle distance, and its wavelength position is influenced by particle charge and the refractive index of the particle's immediate environment.

\section{Problem formulation}
Will report simulation results for the plasmonic properties for [samples] under both longitudinal and transverse polarizations 

Why optimization
