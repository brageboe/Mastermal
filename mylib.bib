Abstract = {We propose a simple analytical formula that can quantitatively predict resonant light scattering from metal nanoparticles of arbitrary shape, whose sizes are too large for Rayleigh approximation to be applicable. The formula has been derived as an empirical extension of Mie’s rigorous calculation for light scattering from spheres.

Strong polarization coupling is observed for ultraviolet wavelengths and around the surface plasmon resonance for which the off-block-diagonal Mueller matrix elements show pronounced anisotropies. Due to the Rayleigh anomalies, the block-diagonal Mueller matrix elements produce a direct image of the Brillouin Zone (BZ) boundaries of the lattice and resonances are observed at the M-point in the first and at the X-point in the second BZ. These elements show also the dispersion of the localized surface plasmon resonance.},

abstract = "Abstract Square arrays of gold (Au) hemispheroids deposited on a UV-transparent glass substrate reveal a rich optical response when investigated by spectroscopic Mueller Matrix Ellipsometry. Two samples were studied; the first consisted of hemispheroids of parallel radius of 58 nm and height 30 nm with lattice constant 210 nm; the corresponding parameters for the second sample were 38 nm, 20 nm and 125 nm, respectively. By a full azimuthal rotation of the samples, we observe all the Rayleigh anomalies corresponding to grazing diffracted waves, with strong resonances for co-polarization scattered light near the high symmetry points and cross-polarization scattered light around the Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance. Polarization-conversion becomes particularly important at grazing incidence, and the cross-polarization follows the Rayleigh lines. The optical response (neglecting polarization conversion) is modelled in the quasi-static approximation using the so-called Bedeaux-Vlieger formalism, and the Finite Element Method using COMSOL. The direct inversion of the effective (substrate dependent) dielectric function is discussed. "
