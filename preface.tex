This thesis has been carried out as part of the requirements for completing the 2-year master's degree program in physics at the Department of Physics of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The project was written under the supervision of Professor Morten Kildemo, starting in October 2016 and finished in August 2017.

I would like to sincerely thank Morten Kildemo for accepting me for this thesis topic, as well as PhD student Per Morten Walmsness, for their continuous support during every stage of the project.
